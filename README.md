## Toggle Nametags: 
### Players can toggle their & other nametags on or off, allowing for flexible roleplay situations.

• /togglemyname - Toggles your own player nametag.

• /toggleallnames - Toggles all other player nametags.

• /toggleid - Removes Id's from player nametags.

• /mask - Masks a players nametag with a anonymous name to hide identity.

## Dynamic Health Indicators: Nametags turn red when players take damage, providing immediate visual feedback during intense moments.

## Masking & Identity Concealment: The script automatically masks player identities when wearing a mask, hiding their real name and displaying a masked alias instead. Nametags revert to the character's true name when the mask is removed.
